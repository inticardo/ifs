ifs
===

IFS is an old experiment written in Perl language. It was proposed as an simple alternative to the Windows application HFS but for Linux/Unix systems. The original goals were:

* A single executable (all-in-one) file.
* Command-line invocation application.
* Ability to download both individual files and groups of files.

Example
-------

	$ ./ifs.pl ./Documents 8080
